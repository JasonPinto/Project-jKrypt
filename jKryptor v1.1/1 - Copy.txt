The time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be

Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray
