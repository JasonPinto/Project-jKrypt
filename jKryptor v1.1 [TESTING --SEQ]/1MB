The time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

No inner peace no after life

For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

I did what I thought was right
AllThe time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

(Bridge)
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
and your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life
